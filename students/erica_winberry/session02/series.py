# Create a new module series.py in the session02 folder in your student folder.
#     In it, add a function called fibonacci.
#     The function should have one parameter n.
#     The function should return the nth value in the fibonacci series.
#     Ensure that your function has a well-formed docstring
# Note that the fibinacci series is naturally recusive â€“ the value is defined by previous values:
#     fib(n) = fib(n-2) + fib(n-1)

def fibonacci(n):
    """Return the nth value in the fibonacci series."""
